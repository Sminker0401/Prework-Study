# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is the very first page I have ever built using coding. 
I built the page using step by step directions as a basic crash cousre into the world of we development.
For me and all people new to coding it helps understand the tools needed on a regular basis.
I learned that even though I have never done this before I stuck to it and troubleshooted when needed. I learned that attention to detail is key when you are writing out code to avoid errors.
